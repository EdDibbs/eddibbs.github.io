Welcome to my new site, built with [Jekyll][jekyll-link] and hosted on [GitHub][github-siterepo]. I'm still learning how to properly use Jekyll (as well as github pages), so this site will likely change quite a bit over the next few days.

This site will mostly house my resume and some links to my projects, though it may contain various blog posts if I feel the urge to write something.

Cheers,

**- Ed**
